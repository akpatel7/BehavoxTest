# EmailArchiveViewer
# BehavoxTest
Techinal test for Behavox June 2020

Instructions:

You need to design and implement a tool for working with an archive of emails.
Technical requirements:

● It needs to be an Angular-based web application.

For the purpose of this task, the email archive will be represented as a JSON file. You need to
build a simple application which could be used to work with the data in this archive. Some of the
basic user operations include viewing, filtering, search, etc.

Functional requirements:

● Filters by date and person contacts.

● Text search.

● Paging of results.

● Bonus - Text search highlight (subject, body).

● Bonus - Email threading.

Assessment criteria

● Completeness from the functional requirements point of view.

● UX of the application.

● Architecture.

Notes

● You don’t need to implement the backend part. It is enough to create a wrapper over the
JSON file on the client side.

It's up to you to decide on the implementation details.
Test task must be uploaded to https://bitbucket.org/.
Before starting to work on the task, please provide an estimation of the time you require to
complete it.
